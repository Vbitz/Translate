It's simple really, take a abstract syntax tree and convert it into a whole bunch of different languages. Simple.
This could be a very powerful trick, the input is json ofcorse, keeping it simple but the output can be any common enough language, or even some of the more obsure ones.

Targets:
Javascript-Node : The code is writen using node, the program could also output a package.json to run npm update
Javascript-Web  : Writen for the web, auto imports libarys and allows for embeded html
Python		: Good for alot of different stuff, loads of standed libarys
C++		: This is where this trick could really shine, output to native c++
C#		: This is a bit more complex, outputs to a series of source files and maybe a VS project file
Java		: This will be much like C#, though outputing to a ant build file
Ruby		: Why the hell not?
